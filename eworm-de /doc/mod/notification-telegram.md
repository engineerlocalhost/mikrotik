Description
-----------

This module adds support for sending notifications via
[Telegram](https://telegram.org/) via bot api. A queue is used to make sure
notifications are not lost on failure but sent later.

Requirements and installation
-----------------------------

Just install the module:

    $ScriptInstallUpdate mod/notification-telegram;

Also install Telegram on at least one of your mobile and/or desktop devices
and create an account.

Configuration
-------------

Open Telegram, then start a chat with [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and
create your own bot:

![create new bot](notification-telegram.d/newbot.avif)

Set that token from *BotFather* (use your own!) to `TelegramTokenId`, for
now just temporarily:

    :set TelegramTokenId "5214364459:AAHLwf1o7ybbKDo6pY24Kd2bZ5rjCakDXTc";

Now open a chat with your bot and start it by clicking the `START` button,
then send your first message. Any text will do. On your device run
`$GetTelegramChatId` to retrieve the chat id:

    $GetTelegramChatId;

![get chat id](notification-telegram.d/getchatid.avif)

Finally edit `global-config-overlay`, add `TelegramTokenId` with the token
from *BotFather* and `TelegramChatId` with your retrieved chat id. Then
reload the configuration.

> ℹ️ **Info**: Copy relevant configuration from
> [`global-config`](../../global-config.rsc) (the one without `-overlay`) to
> your local `global-config-overlay` and modify it to your specific needs.

### Notifications to a group

Sending notifications to a group is possible as well. Add your bot to a group
and make it an admin (required for read access!) and send a message and run
`$GetTelegramChatId` again. Then use that chat id (which starts with a dash)
for `TelegramChatId`.

Groups can enable the `Topics` feature. Use `TelegramThreadId` to send to a
specific topic in a group.

Usage and invocation
--------------------

There's nothing special to do. Every script or function sending a notification
will now send it to your Telegram account.

But of course you can use the function to send notifications directly. Give
it a try:

    $SendTelegram "Subject..." "Body...";

Alternatively this sends a notification with all available and configured
methods:

    $SendNotification "Subject..." "Body...";

To use the functions in your own scripts you have to declare them first.
Place this before you call them:

    :global SendTelegram;
    :global SendNotification;

In case there is a situation when the queue needs to be purged there is a
function available:

    $PurgeTelegramQueue;

Tips & Tricks
-------------

### Set a profile photo

You can use a profile photo for your bot to make it recognizable. Open the
chat with [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and set it there.

![set profile photo](notification-telegram.d/setuserpic.avif)

Have a look at my
[RouterOS-Scripts Logo Color Changer](https://git.eworm.de/cgit/routeros-scripts/plain/contrib/logo-color.html)
to create a colored version of this scripts' logo.
