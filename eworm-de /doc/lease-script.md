Description
-----------

This script is supposed to run from dhcp server as lease script. On a dhcp
lease it runs each script containing the following line, where `##` is a
decimal number for ordering:

    # provides: lease-script, order=##

Currently it runs if available, in order:

* [dhcp-to-dns](dhcp-to-dns.md)
* [collect-wireless-mac](collect-wireless-mac.md)
* [dhcp-lease-comment](dhcp-lease-comment.md)
* `hotspot-to-wpa-cleanup`, which is an optional cleanup script
  of [hotspot-to-wpa](hotspot-to-wpa.md)

Requirements and installation
-----------------------------

Just install the script:

    $ScriptInstallUpdate lease-script;

... and add it as `lease-script` to your dhcp server:

    /ip/dhcp-server/set lease-script=lease-script [ find ];
