Description
-----------

RouterOS can act on received SMS. Reboot the device from remote or do
whatever is required.

A broadband interface with SMS support is required.

Requirements and installation
-----------------------------

Just install the script:

    $ScriptInstallUpdate sms-action;

Configuration
-------------

The configuration goes to `global-config-overlay`, this is the only parameter:

* `SmsAction`: an array with pre-defined actions

> ℹ️ **Info**: Copy relevant configuration from
> [`global-config`](../global-config.rsc) (the one without `-overlay`) to
> your local `global-config-overlay` and modify it to your specific needs.

Then enable SMS actions:

    /tool/sms/set allowed-number=+491234567890 receive-enabled=yes secret=s3cr3t;

Usage and invocation
--------------------

Send a SMS from allowed number to your device's phone number:

    :cmd s3cr3t script sms-action action=reboot;

The value given by "`action=`" is one of the pre-defined actions from
`SmsAction`.
